# single-page-cv
My single page CV website, builded using HTML and some, really some CSS

## Description
I really need some practice in HTML, because u learn some stuff, features, but if u can`t apply it for the real purpose, for what u are learning it?
I think this, so u see this site.

## Preview
### With CSS
<img width="1829" height="1048" alt="изображение" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c3bb19c-bc15-439d-aa01-a9afd040ce52" />

### And without CSS it looks so awful
<img width="1054" height="942" alt="изображение" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88bea265-b2b5-4ef5-86e0-c24e3d381cee" />
